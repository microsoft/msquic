MsQuic
======

MsQuic is a Microsoft implementation of the [IETF QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/about/)
protocol. It is cross platform, written in C and designed to be a general purpose QUIC library.

> **Important** The QUIC protocol is currently in IETF last call (not RFC quite yet). MsQuic implements the latest published drafts.

## Protocol Features

QUIC has many benefits when compared to existing "TLS over TCP" scenarios:

  * All packets are encrypted and handshake is authenticated with TLS 1.3.
  * Parallel streams of (reliable and unreliable) application data.
  * Exchange application data in the first round trip (0-RTT).
  * Improved congestion control and loss recovery.
  * Survives a change in the clients IP address or port.
  * Stateless load balancing.
  * Easily extendable for new features and extensions.

## Library Features

MsQuic has several features that differentiates it from other QUIC implementations:

  * Optimized for client and server.
  * Optimized for maximal throughput and minimal latency.
  * Asynchronous IO.
  * Receive side scaling ([RSS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/introduction-to-receive-side-scaling)) support.
  * UDP send and receive coalescing support.

For information on contributing, please see our [contribution guidlines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

> **Important** - We are still bringing up important regression tests for the core code. Until they are onboarded, any external contributions to the [core](./src/core) or kernel mode files in the [platform](./src/platform) will not be accepted. This is only a **temporary restriction** and we are working to complete it by the end of 2020.
