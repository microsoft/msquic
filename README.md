MsQuic
======

MsQuic is a Microsoft implementation of the [IETF QUIC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-quic-transport)
protocol. It is cross platform, written in C and designed to be a general purpose QUIC library.

> **Important** The MsQuic library, as well as the protocol itself, is still a work in progress. Version 1 is not yet finalized and may continue to experience breaking changes until it is finalized.

[![Build Status](https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/OS/_apis/build/status/microsoft.msquic?branchName=master)](https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/OS/_build/latest?definitionId=45975&branchName=master)

## Protocol Features

QUIC has many benefits when compared to existing TLS over TCP scenarios:

  * Handshake authenticated with TLS 1.3
  * All packets are encrypted
  * Parallel streams of application data.
  * Improved (compared to TCP) congestion control and loss recovery.
  * Exchange application data in the first round trip (0-RTT).
  * Survives a change in the clients IP address or port.
  * Easily extendable for new features (such as unreliable delivery).

> **Important** Several QUIC protocol features are not yet fully implemented:
>
>  * 0-RTT with Schannel and OpenSSL
>  * Client Migration
>  * Server Preferred Address
>  * Path MTU Discovery

## Library Features

  * Cross-platform support.
  * Optimized for maximal throughput and minimal latency.
  * Asynchronous IO.
  * Receive side scaling (RSS).
  * UDP send and receive coalescing support.

## Building

You can find detailed instructions for building the library [here](./docs/BUILD.md).

## Documentation

You can find more detailed information on how to use MsQuic in the [the API documentation](./docs/API.md).

## Source Code

The source (found in the `src` directory) is divided into several directories:

  * `bin` - Packages up all static libraries into the platform specific binaries.
  * `core` - Platform independent code that implements the QUIC protocol.
  * `inc` - Header files used by all the other directories.
  * `manifest` - Windows [ETW manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wes/writing-an-instrumentation-manifest) and related files.
  * `platform` - Platform specific code for OS types, sockets and TLS.
  * `submodules` - All the modules that MsQuic depends on.
  * `test` - Test code for the MsQuic API / protocol.
  * `tools` - Tools for exercising MsQuic.
    * `attack` - Adversarial tool for exploiting protocol weaknesses.
    * `etw` - Windows specific tool for processing MsQuic ETW logs.
    * `interop` - Runs through the [IETF interop scenarios](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/16th-Implementation-Draft).
    * `ping` - Simple tool for gathering throughput measurements. Read more [here](./tools/ping/readme.md).
    * `reach` - Tests for QUIC reachability of a server for several well-known ALPNs.
    * `sample` - Minimal example of how to use the MsQuic API.
    * `spin` - Randomly executes the MsQuic API to discover bugs.
    * `void` - Randomly starts and stops the server to discover bugs.
