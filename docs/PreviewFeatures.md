New features added to the MsQuic library are exposed through newly added API as a preview, for stabilization and gradual adoption.

These new API are first made available in the export headers only in the **Preview mode**. The underlying functionality is still present in the MsQuic library but is unreachable through regular API.

When a new feature is deemed ready for wider use, its API is moved from the preview portion to the regular portion of MsQuic library headers.

## QUIC_API_ENABLE_PREVIEW_FEATURES

A preview feature's API declarations (typically in msquic.h) are placed within pre-processor conditional sections that are enabled using the QUIC_API_ENABLE_PREVIEW_FEATURES macro, to isolate it from the rest of the established API.

Any application wanting to use the preview features must declare this macro (and set it to 1) before including the MsQuic headers.
