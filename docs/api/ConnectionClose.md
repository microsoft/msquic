ConnectionClose function
======

Closes an existing connection.

# Syntax

```C
typedef
_IRQL_requires_max_(PASSIVE_LEVEL)
void
(QUIC_API * QUIC_CONNECTION_CLOSE_FN)(
    _In_ _Pre_defensive_ __drv_freesMem(Mem)
        HQUIC Connection
    );
```

# Parameters

`Connection`

The valid handle to an open connection object.

# Remarks

`ConnectionClose` cleans up and frees all resources allocated for the connection in `ConnectionOpen`.

A caller should shutdown an active connection via `ConnectionShutdown` before calling `ConnectionClose`; calling `ConnectionClose` without `ConnectionShutdown` will implicitly call `ConnectionShutdown` with the `QUIC_CONNECTION_SHUTDOWN_FLAG_SILENT` flag.

`ConnectionClose` is the **last** API call to use a connection handle. An application **MUST NOT** use a connection handle after calling `ConnectionClose`! Any calls using a connection handle after calling `ConnectionClose` is a use-after-free.
