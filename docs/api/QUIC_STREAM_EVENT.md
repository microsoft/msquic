# Parameters

`Type`

The `QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_TYPE` that indicates which type of event this is, and which payload to reference (if any) for additional information.

# Remarks

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_START_COMPLETE

This event is delivered when the [StreamStart](StreamStart.md) operation completes. The accompanying payload contains data to indicate whether the operation succeeded or failed.

### START_COMPLETE

Additional state from the `StreamStart` operation is included in this payload struct/union.

`Status`

QUIC_STATUS value to indicate the operation completion code. Check for success using the QUIC_SUCCEEDED macro.

`ID`

Stream ID if available.

`PeerAccepted`

If TRUE, the peer has accepted the stream.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_RECEIVE

Data received on an open stream is primarily delivered to the application through this event.

### RECEIVE

Received data on the stream is passed in this struct/union.

`AbsoluteOffset`

Absolute offset of the current data payload from the start of the receive operation.

`TotalBufferLength`

MsQuic indicates the total buffer length of the data in this parameter.

Receiving data goes beyond handling of this stream event callback. See [Receiving Data On Streams](../Streams.md#Receiving) for the various different approaches to receiving data on a stream.

Upon successful handling of this event, the event handler should return one of `QUIC_STATUS_SUCCESS` or `QUIC_STATUS_CONTINUE` or `QUIC_STATUS_PENDING` to the MsQuic library, depending on the chosen approach to handling the received data.

`Buffers`

An array of `QUIC_BUFFER`s containing received data.

`BufferCount`

Count of `QUIC_BUFFER`s in this payload.

`Flags`

A set of flags indicating describing the received data:

Value | Meaning
--- | ---
**QUIC_RECEIVE_FLAG_NONE**<br>0 | No special behavior.
**QUIC_RECEIVE_FLAG_0_RTT**<br>1 | The data was received in 0-RTT.
**QUIC_RECEIVE_FLAG_FIN**<br>2 | FIN was included with this data. Used only for streamed data.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_SEND_COMPLETE

Indicates that MsQuic has completed a [StreamSend](StreamSend.md) operation initated by the application.

This is an important event in the asynchronous process of sending data over a stream.
More info here:
- [Send Buffering](../Streams.md#Send_Buffering)
- [QUIC_BUFFER Handling Note](StreamSend.md#Remarks)

### SEND_COMPLETE

Data for `StreamSend` completion is included in this struct/union.

`Canceled`
Indicates that the StreamSend operation was canceled.

`ClientContext`
Client context to match this event with the original `StreamSend` operation.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_PEER_SEND_SHUTDOWN

Indicates that the send direction of the stream **from the peer** has been shutdown and no further data is expected to be received on this stream.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_PEER_SEND_ABORTED

Indicates that the peer has aborted `StreamSend` operation.

### SEND_ABORTED

Additional details of the send abort event are passed in this struct/union.

`ErrorCode`

Application's protocol specific, 62-bit error code.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_PEER_RECEIVE_ABORTED

Indicates that the peer has aborted receiving data.

### RECEIVE_ABORTED

Additional details of the receive abort event are passed in this struct/union.

`ErrorCode`

Application's protocol specific, 62-bit error code.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_SEND_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE

This event is raised when the send direction of the stream **to the peer** has been shutdown and no further data can be sent on this stream.

### SEND_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE

Additional details of send shutdown completion are passed in this struct/union.

`Graceful`

TRUE if the send shutdown operation was gracefully shutdown, FALSE otherwise.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE

This event indicates that the stream has been completely shutdown.

### SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE

Additional details for the stream shutdown are passed in this struct/union.

`ConnectionShutdown`

If TRUE, the Connection corresponding to this stream has been closed locally or remotely.

`AppCloseInProgress`

If TRUE, the application is in the process of closing the stream.

`ConnectionShutdownByApp`

If TRUE, the application shutdown the Connection corresponding to this stream.

`ConnectionClosedRemotely`

If TRUE, the Connection corresponding to this stream has been closed remotely.

`ConnectionErrorCode`

62-bit Connection closure error code, if any.

`ConnectionCloseStatus`

QUIC_STATUS value of the connection close operation, if any.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_IDEAL_SEND_BUFFER_SIZE

MsQuic indicates the ideal send buffer size to the application through this event, so as not to idle the connection.

### IDEAL_SEND_BUFFER_SIZE

Ideal send buffer size is indicated in this struct/union.

`ByteCount`

Ideal send buffer size in bytes for each `StreamSend` operation to avoid idling the connection.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_PEER_ACCEPTED

This event is raised when a peer has provided sufficient flow control to accept a new stream. See [StreamStart](StreamStart.md) for additional information.

## QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_CANCEL_ON_LOSS

This event is raised when a stream is shutdown due to packet loss. See [Cancel on Loss](../Streams.md#Cancel_On_Loss) for further details.

### CANCEL_ON_LOSS

The application can supply an error code in this struct to be sent to the peer.

`ErrorCode`

The application can set this 62 bit error code to communicate to the peer about the stream shutdown, which is received by the peer as a `QUIC_STREAM_EVENT_PEER_SEND_ABORTED` event on its stream object.
