# Support for MsQuic

An MsQuic release begins its life in the main branch where it receives feature updates as well as servicing for security and bug fixes. When it is time to release, the code will be forked into a release branch where it is considered stable and will generally only receive servicing for security and bug fixes.

## MsQuic Branches

MsQuic has two main types of branches **main** and **release** defined as:

* **Main** - Main is the primary development branch, and receives security and bug fixes just the same as the release branches. However, the main branch is where active development happens and because of this the main branch may experience breaking changes as we develop new features.

* **Release** - Release branches only receive security and bug fixes, and are considered stable. There should be no breaking changes in these branches, and they can be used for stable products.

  * **Prerelease** - The [Releases](Release.md#releases) section below indicates which releases are considered officially supported and serviced releases. All others are considered prereleases, which are generally considered stable, but will **not receive servicing fixes**.

\* Both main and official release branches receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability.

## Release Support Policies

MsQuic support lifecycle is governed by the Windows Server servicing channels: [LTSC and SAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started-19/servicing-channels-19)

* **LTSC** indicates official release branches to be serviced for 5 years mainstream and 5 years extended.
* **SAC** indicates official release branches to be serviced for 18 months.
* **PRE** indicates prerelease branches (**not** officially supported).
* **TBD** indicates release branches that are set to be classified as one of the above.

> **Important** Main and prerelease branches are considered not **officially supported**.
>  * Prerelease branches get no further changes.
>  * Main is under active development (i.e. not stable), however it does receive security and bug fixes.

## End of support

End of support refers to the date when Microsoft no longer provides fixes, updates, or online technical assistance for your product. As this date nears, make sure you have the latest available update installed. Without Microsoft support, you will no longer receive security updates that can help protect your machine from harmful viruses, spyware, and other malicious software that can steal your personal information.

# Releases

A release branch will be created (forked) for each release of MsQuic. Official release branches will then go through a several month stabilization process before it is then finalized. Once finalized, offical release branches will only be serviced with security and bug fixes throughout its lifecycle. MsQuic official releases generally will correspond to Windows releases, but in some cases additional future releases may be created for other major products. Official releases for Windows generally will end support at the same time as the Windows release.

This table describes all MsQuic releases, both officially supported (LTSC or SAC) and unsupported (PRE).

## MsQuic v1.0 (LTSC)

[MsQuic v1.0](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic/releases/tag/v1.0.0-129524) is the first officially supported release.

Official (v1) RFC and draft-29 are supported by this release.

### Breaking Changes

- Fix QUIC_SETTINGS across different versions (#2271)
- Remove synchronous StreamStart (#2312)
- Remove Level from SetParam/GetParam (#2322)
- Add new datagram send state enum (#2342)
- Add support for async listener stop (#2346)
- Refactor custom CID prefix (#2363)
- Make StreamReceiveComplete not fail (#2371)

#### Upgrade Notes

The following changes will be necessary for apps that upgrade from v1.* to v2.0:

- Remove any usage of `QUIC_STREAM_START_FLAG_ASYNC`, replacing with `QUIC_STREAM_START_FLAG_NONE` if no other flags are used. If the flag was not used before, the app code must handle the call not blocking any more.
- Remove all `Level` parameters passed to `GetParam` or `SetParam`.
- Ensure the app handles `ListenerStop` not blocking any more. `ListenerClose` still blocks.
- No more need to check for a return code from `StreamReceiveComplete`.
- QUIC_ADDRESS_FAMILY_IPV6 has been changed to be platform specific rather then always windows values. For C/C++ consumers this is only a binary breaking change. For Interop consumers, the value will change for linux and macOS.

# Publishing a Release

## Create a New Release Branch

1. Add (via PR) notes above for the new release.
2. Fork `main` branch to `release/X.Y` where `X` is the major version and `Y` is the minor version.
3. Update (via PR) the minor version for the `main` branch:
   - Run `./scripts/update-version.ps1 -Part Minor` to generate the relavent changes.

## Servicing a Release Branch

1. Changes first go into the `main` branch, and then are cherry-picked into the relavent `release/X.Y` branches.
2. Update (via PR) the patch version for the release branches:
   - Run `./scripts/update-version.ps1 -Part Patch` to generate the relavent changes.

## Publishing a Release Branch

1. Create a [new GitHub release](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic/releases/new) along with the corresponding tag.
   - Make sure to pick the correct `release/X.Y` branch
   - The tag should be the full version number: `vX.Y.Z`
   - The release title should be `MsQuic vX.Y.Z`
   - Put relavent information in the notes of the release (see previous releases for examples)
2. Wait for [msquic-Official](https://mscodehub.visualstudio.com/msquic/_build?definitionId=1738&_a=summary) pipeline to run for the newly created tag.
3. Download the signed Linux packages (under `drop_package_linux_distribution`), upload them to the GitHub release and publish them (via [MsQuic-Publish](https://mscodehub.visualstudio.com/msquic/_build?definitionId=2068)) to https://packages.microsoft.com:
   - libmsquic-X.Y.Z-1-aarch64.rpm
