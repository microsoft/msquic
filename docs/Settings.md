# MsQuic Settings

MsQuic supports a number of configuration knobs (or settings). These settings can either be set dynamically (via the [QUIC_SETTINGS](./api/QUIC_SETTINGS.md) structure) or via persistent storage (e.g. registry on Windows).

> **Warning**
> Generally MsQuic already choses the best / most correct default values for all settings. Settings should only be changed after due diligence and A/B testing is performed.

MsQuic settings are available on most MsQuic API objects. [Here](#api-object-parameters) we'll provide an overview of them with links to further details.

## Windows Registry

MsQuic supports most of the settings in the QUIC_SETTINGS struct in the registry to be loaded as defaults when the MsQuic library is loaded in a process.  These registry settings only provide the defaults; the application is free to change the settings with a call to [SetParam](./api/SetParam.md) or in [QUIC_SETTINGS](./api/QUIC_SETTINGS.md) structs passed into [ConfigurationOpen](./api/ConfigurationOpen.md).

The default settings are updated automatically in the application when changing the registry, assuming the application hasn't already changed the setting, which overrides the registry value. However, this does not change the settings on Connections which are already established, or Configurations which are already created.

Note: MaxWorkerQueueDelay uses **milliseconds** in the registry, but uses microseconds (us) in the [QUIC_SETTINGS](./api/QUIC_SETTINGS.md) struct.

The following settings are unique to the registry:

| Setting                            | Type     | Registry Name           | Default           | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Max Worker Queue Delay             | uint32_t | MaxWorkerQueueDelayMs   |               250 | The maximum queue delay (in ms) allowed for a worker thread.                                                |
| Max Partition Count                | uint16_t | MaxPartitionCount       |  System CPU count | The maximum processor count used for partitioning work in MsQuic. Max 512. **Restart is required.**         |

The types map to registry types as follows:
  - `uint64_t` is a `REG_QWORD`.
  - `uint32_t`, `uint16_t`, and `uint8_t` are `REG_DWORD`.

While `REG_DWORD` can hold values larger than `uint16_t`, the administrator should ensure they do not exceed the maximum value of 65,535 when configuring a `uint16_t` setting via the Windows Registry.

The following settings are available via registry as well as via [QUIC_VERSION_SETTINGS](./Versions.md):

| Setting                           | Type       | Registry Name            | Default           | Description                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Acceptable Versions List          | uint32_t[] | AcceptableVersions       | Unset             | Sets the list of versions that a given server instance will use if a client sends a first flight using them. |
| Offered Versions List             | uint32_t[] | OfferedVersions          | Unset             | Sets the list of versions that a given server instance will send in a Version Negotiation packet if it receives a first flight from an unknown version. This list will most often be equal to the Acceptable Versions list. |
| Fully-Deployed Versions List      | uint32_t[] | FullyDeployedVersions    | Unset             | Sets the list of QUIC versions that is supported and negotiated by every single QUIC server instance in this deployment. Used to generate the AvailableVersions list in the Version Negotiation Extension Transport Parameter. |

The `uint32_t[]` type is a `REG_BINARY` blob of the versions list, with each version in little-endian format.

All restrictions and effects on the versions mentioned in [QUIC_VERSION_SETTINGS](./Versions.md) apply to the registry-set versions as well.

Particularly, on server, these must be set **GLOBALLY** if you want them to take effect for servers.

## QUIC_SETTINGS

A [QUIC_SETTINGS](./api/QUIC_SETTINGS.md) struct is used to configure settings on a `Configuration` handle, `Connection` handle, or globally.

For more details see [QUIC_SETTINGS](./api/QUIC_SETTINGS.md).

# API Object Parameters

### QUIC_PARAM_CONN_STATISTICS_V2

Querying the `QUIC_STATISTICS_V2` struct via `QUIC_PARAM_CONN_STATISTICS_V2` or `QUIC_PARAM_CONN_STATISTICS_V2_PLAT` should be aware of possible changes in the size of the struct, depending on the version of MsQuic the app using at runtime, not just what it was compiled against.

The minimum size of the struct will always be `QUIC_STATISTICS_V2_SIZE_1`. Future version of MsQuic will append new fields to the end of the struct, so the maximum possible size will increase.

When an app queries for the statistics, it must always supply an input buffer of length at least `QUIC_STATISTICS_V2_SIZE_1`, but `sizeof(QUIC_STATISTICS_V2)` will always work as well. MsQuic will support older callers that supply at least that buffer size, even if the maximum size of the struct has grown in a future version of MsQuic. MsQuic will only write the fields that can completely fit in the buffer supplied by the app.
