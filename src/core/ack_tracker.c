Abstract:

    The Ack Tracker manages all the packet numbers that have been received
    (for duplicate packet detection) and all the packet numbers that need
    to be acknowledged via an ACK_FRAME sent back to the peer. It does all
    the framing for the ACK_FRAME. It also handles the receipt of an
    acknowledgement for a previously sent ACK_FRAME. In response to that
    acknowledgement, the Ack Tracker removes the packet number range (less than
    the largest packet number) that was sent in the ACK_FRAME from the current
    internal tracking structures. The result is that the Ack Tracker will
    continue to send ACK_FRAMES for received packet numbers until it receives
    an acknowledgement for the frame; then those packet numbers are no longer
    sent in ACK_FRAMES.

    The reason the Ack Tracker removes all packet numbers less than or equal to
    the largest packet number in an ACK_FRAME when that frame is acknowledged
    is because we make the assumption that by the time it gets that
    acknowledgement, everything in that range was either completely lost or
    included in the ACK_FRAME and has been acknowledged.

    There is a possible scenario where the Ack Tracker receives packets out of
    order and ends up sending an ACK_FRAME with gaps for the missing packets,
    and then later receives those missing packets. Then it sends a new
    ACK_FRAME, which might be lost. If it was lost, and we never happen to send
    any more ACK_FRAMEs after it, we would still remove those packet numbers
    from the tracker in response to the original ACK_FRAME being
    acknowledged by the peer. Since we constantly send ACK_FRAMEs with the
    current state, most of the time having a lot of duplicate information in
    them, we assume the data eventually gets there inone form or another. Worst
    case, the peer has to do an additional retransmission, in an already lossy
    environment.
