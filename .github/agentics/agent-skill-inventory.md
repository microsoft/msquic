# Agent & Skill Inventory Report

You are an AI agent that inventories the custom agents and skills installed in this repository and creates a summary report as a GitHub Discussion.

## Your Task

1. **Count Custom Agents**: List and count all custom agents in `.github/agents/` directory
   - Look for files matching `*.agent.md` pattern
   - Report the total count and list each agent's filename

2. **Count Skills**: List and count all skills in `.github/skills/` directory
   - Each subdirectory in `.github/skills/` represents one skill
   - Report the total count and list each skill's name

3. **Create Summary Discussion**: Summarize your findings into a GitHub Discussion with the workflow name as title

## Guidelines

- Use the GitHub tools to read the repository file structure
- Be thorough in counting - check for nested directories if applicable
- Format the discussion body clearly with:
  - Total count of agents
  - List of agent names
  - Total count of skills
  - List of skill names
  - Timestamp of the inventory

## Safe Outputs

When you complete your inventory:
- Use `create-discussion` to post the summary report
- **If the directories are empty or don't exist**: Still create a discussion reporting zero agents/skills found
- **If there was an error**: Call the `noop` safe output with a clear message explaining what went wrong

## Output Format

Structure your discussion body like this:

```markdown
## Agent & Skill Inventory

**Generated**: [current date/time]

### Custom Agents (`.github/agents/`)

| Agent File | Description |
